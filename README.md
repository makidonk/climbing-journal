# Climbing Journal 🧗‍♀️

A personal bouldering log built with Next.js and Strapi.  
This app helps me keep track of climbing problems I've tried, completed, or failed – with media, notes, and difficulty filtering.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**
- **Backend (CMS)**: [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) – Headless CMS
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

---

## 📦 Features

- Log climbs with:
  - Title, color
  - Thumbnail and multiple media entries (video/images)
  - Notes (Markdown)
  - Date
- Dynamic frontend page for viewing all climbs (coming soon!)
- Sortable/filterable (coming soon!)
- Uses Strapi API with `populate=*` to fetch all media and data
